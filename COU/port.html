          <h2><a href="#project1">Optimizing Convenience Store Location in Liverpool Using GIS</a></h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Objective:</strong> The project aims to determine the optimal site for a new convenience store with a click and collect facility for Marks & Spencer in Liverpool using Geographic Information Systems (GIS).</li>
            <li><strong>Factors Considered:</strong> The analysis takes into account various factors such as online grocery shopping prevalence, working population, household size, affluence, and competition from other retailers.</li>
            <li><strong>Methodology:</strong> Internet User Classification (IUC) 2018 data was re-coded into categories based on online grocery shopping prevalence. Additional datasets from Nomis Business Register and Employment Survey 2020, IMD 2019, Census 2011, and Geolytix Open Data were utilized.</li>
            <li><strong>Competition Analysis:</strong> Fixed Distance and Drive Distance catchments were plotted for all convenience stores and supermarkets with click and collect facilities to understand and avoid revenue cannibalization.</li>
            <li><strong>Optimal Site Identification:</strong> Potential locations were identified by intersecting high online grocery shopping LSOAs with chosen retailer's catchments, considering factors like major employers, visibility, and road connectivity.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Visualization:</strong> Various maps were created, including online grocery shopping prevalence, deprived areas, food store catchments, daytime population, and household density, to support site selection.</li>
            <li><strong>Proposed Site: </strong> The optimal site for the new convenience store is near Liverpool Hope University, which has a high working population and no nearby competing stores, providing a significant opportunity.</li>
            <li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The chosen site offers a strategic advantage due to its location near a large student population and the lack of nearby convenience stores, which can potentially attract a high number of customers.</li>

          <h2><a href="#project2">Geo-Demographic Insights for Bay Area Policy Making</a></h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Objective:</strong> To analyze various datasets related to the Bay Area and extract useful insights for policymakers using Geographic Data Science techniques.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Sources:</strong> Utilized datasets include Airbnb listings, socio-economic metrics from the American Community Survey (ACS), vehicle counts, and electricity utility rates.</li>
            <li><strong>GIS Methods:</strong>  Employed Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and R programming to map and analyze data, using <em>EPSG: 2227 - NAD 83 California zone 3</em> (ftUS) projection for accurate spatial representation.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Preprocessing:</strong> Cleaned and merged datasets, including Airbnb data, ACS data for median household income and internet use, and additional datasets on vehicle counts and electricity rates.</li>
            <li><strong>Spatial Analysis:</strong> Conducted spatial joins to overlay Airbnb listings with ZIP code areas, performed spatial clustering using K-means, and calculated spatial auto-correlation metrics like Moran's I.</li>
            <li><strong>Visualization:</strong> Created various maps to visualize Airbnb listings, median household income, internet usage, and other socio-economic indicators across the Bay Area.</li>
            <li><strong>Findings:  </strong> Identified distinct neighborhood typologies such as tourist-focused areas, residential areas, and economically diverse areas based on clustering results and socio-economic indicators.</li>
            <li><strong>Policy Implications:</strong> Provided recommendations for targeting areas in need of development, managing tourist activities, improving public transportation, and enhancing community services based on spatial analysis findings.</li>
